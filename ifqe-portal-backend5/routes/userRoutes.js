 * @access  Private (Admin role only)
 *
 * Middleware Chain:
 * 1. `protect`: Ensures the request is made by a logged-in user.
 * 2. `authorize('admin')`: Ensures the logged-in user has the 'admin' role.

 * @access  Public
 *          This route is intentionally public and does not use any middleware,
 *          as it is the main entry point for all users to get authenticated.

 * @route   GET /api/users/profile
 * @desc    Get the profile information of the currently logged-in user.
 * @access  Private (Any authenticated user)
 *
 * Middleware Chain:
 * 1. `protect`: Verifies the JWT and attaches the authenticated user's data to `req.user`.
 *          The `getUserProfile` controller then uses `req.user` to send back the profile.
 *          No `authorize` middleware is needed because any logged-in user can view their own profile.
